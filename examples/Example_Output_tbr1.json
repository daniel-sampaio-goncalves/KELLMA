 "Summary": "Tbr1 encodes a T\u2011box transcription factor that is expressed early in glutamatergic progenitors and marks deep\u2011layer cortical neurons and mitral/tufted cells of the olfactory bulb. In the olfactory bulb, Tbr1+ neurons are markedly reduced in Neurog1/2 double\u2011mutant embryos, indicating that Tbr1 is required for the generation and proper migration of glutamatergic projection neurons. Loss of Tbr1 leads to lamination defects in both the olfactory bulb and the cerebral cortex, with mispositioned neurons and disrupted layer formation. In the cortex, Tbr1 is a defining marker of layer\u202fVI corticothalamic projection neurons and is essential for their identity and axonal targeting. Tbr1 regulates neuronal differentiation and laminar fate specification, coordinating the transition from progenitor to post\u2011mitotic neuron and ensuring correct layer placement. In Tbr1 mutants, neuronal numbers are decreased, migration is aberrant, and cortical lamination is disrupted, underscoring its pivotal role in establishing the architecture of the olfactory bulb and the deep cortical layers. In summary, TBR1 is a key transcription factor that governs the differentiation, migration, and laminar positioning of deep\u2011layer glutamatergic neurons in the olfactory bulb and cortex.",

  "mouse brains, we also stained for Pax6, TBR1, and PH3 in order to observe overall effects on cortical development in the Kif13b cKO condition. TBR1, a marker for newly produced neurons, was chosen in order to determine if neuron production was increased in the Kif13b cKO mouse model at an early cortical developmental stage, when there are relatively few TBR1+ cells. As expected from the results seen in rat brain, Kif13b cKO resulted in a decrease in the number of Pax6 positive cells (Fig. S2d), and an increase in the number of TBR1 positive cells (Fig. S2e). Kif13b cKO mice also showed an increase in the percentage of PH3 positive cells that were located at a distance from the ventricular surface, indicative of proliferating IPs (Fig. S2f). These results, together with the results seen in rat brains at E18 and E19, show that loss of Kif13b in RGPs results in increased mitotic spindle angles, which in turn increases the number of IPs produced and increases neurogenesis early in development. After observing the effects of Kif1a shRNA and Kif13b shRNA independently, we next combined the two. By adding the Kif13b shRNA sequence into a vector with RFP rather than GFP, we"

  "than control organoids (Fig. 6, B and C). To investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying the increased organoid size by 2BAct treatment, we used Ki67 to label all cycling cells followed by the analyses of VZ/SVZ-like cortical regions in the organoids. IHC staining showed that there is a significant increase of Ki67-positive cells in mutant organoids after 2BAct treatment (Fig. 6, D and E). We then used BrdU to mark G1-S transition cells and found that 2BAct treatment rescued BrdU+ cell reduction in the mutant organoids (Fig. 6, D and E). In parallel, we used p-H3 staining to label mitotic cells and found that 2BAct can significantly increase the percentage of p-H3\u2013positive cells, which are reduced in mutants compared to control organoids (Fig. 6, F and G). To investigate how restored NPC behaviors by 2BAct affect neuronal production, we examined cortical layer neurons. Consistent with rescuing effects on NPC proliferation, 2BAct treatment significantly increased TBR1-positive neurons in mutant cerebral organoids (Fig. 6, H and I). Together, these results suggest that 2BAct is functionally important and can partially rescue neuronal cell fate and growth defects in SNORD118*5C>G cerebral organoids. 2BAct alleviates brain ribosomopathy defects in mice in vivo To test in vivo",
  "A and B). To investigate the cellular basis of reduced organoid sizes, we performed immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and examined T-Brain-1 (TBR1)\u2013labeled layer V-VI neurons and Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2)\u2013labeled layer II-V neurons. There is a significant decrease in TBR1- and SATB2-positive neurons in the ventricular zone (VZ)/SVZ\u2013like regions of SNORD118+/\u2212 organoids compared to controls (Fig. 1, C to F). These results suggest that SNORD118 is required for neuron production during human brain development. To investigate how SNORD118 disease mutations affect human brain development, we focused on homozygous *5C>G point mutations, which occur repeatedly in patient families. We combined single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) with CRISPR-Cas9 complex to introduce disease-specific mutation into hiPSCs and generated homozygous SNORD118*5C>G point mutations, which contain C to G changes in the 3\u2032 extension region of SNORD118. The DNA sequence of three independent lines confirmed SNORD118*5C>G homozygous mutations. We then generated SNORD118*5C > G homozygous mutant cerebral organoids with isogeneic controls. Whereas no difference was detected in week 4 organoids, SNORD118*5C>G mutant cerebral organoids showed a smaller size at 6- to 8-week-old ages with significantly reduced surface areas (Fig. 1, G and H).

In contrast, Tbr2, an intermediate marker (Fig. 2G), Tbr1, a postmitotic marker expressed at a later stages (Fig. 2H) and the lineage markers (Tuj1, Gfap and Mbp) were significantly reduced in Lsh\u2212/\u2212 cultures at day 6, consistent with a maturation delay in Lsh\u2212/\u2212 cultures (Fig. 2I,J and K). In addition, WT cultures expressed small amounts of lineage markers (Tuj1, Gfap, Mbp) in the absence of exogenous differentiation signals, whereas no mature lineage markers were expressed in Lsh\u2212/\u2212 neurospheres under these conditions (Supplement Fig. 2A,B). Collectively, our data suggests that Lsh\u2212/\u2212 neural stem cells are capable to develop into the main neural lineages, albeit with a slight delay of mature marker expression under in vitro conditions. We conclude that the impaired capacity for proliferation/self-renewal in the absence of Lsh is not due to premature differentiation but involves a distinct molecular pathway. Altered Bmp4 and Cdkn1a expression in Lsh\u2212/\u2212 NSPCs To reveal key factors that mediate growth repression upon Lsh deletion, we used an unbiased approach and performed RNA-seq analysis in passage 2 neurospheres.

  "(Figures S1E-S1F). At W5, cells within the organoid segregated into well-defined SOX2+ VZ progenitor and TBR1+ preplate-like neuronal layers (Figures 1F-1G). By W8, a prominent TBR2+ SVZ, thicker subplate, CP regions, and REELIN+ marginal zone formed, and each compartment continued to expand over time (Figures 1F-1G and S1H). The markers expressed by W8 and older organoids were similarly expressed within the GW14 human fetal cortex (Figures 1H- 1I), indicating that our organoid system efficiently recapitulates the histological organization and patterned expression of key developmental regulators within the human fetal cortex in vivo. Generation of ventral telencephalic organoids We examined whether our methods could be modified through the addition of morphogen signals to systematically generate different brain regions. To mimic the ventralizing activities of Sonic hedgehog, which is essential for the formation of the basal ganglionic eminences (GE), we pulsed organoids with Smoothened agonist (SAG) at 15 \u2013 21 days in vitro (Figure S3A). Lateral (LGE), medial (MGE), and caudal (CGE) progenitor markers were upregulated in a SAG dose-dependent manner. Exposure to high amounts of SAG (1 \u03bcM) led to the expression of the MGE/CGE marker NKX2.1 in \u223c50% of cells at W5 (Figures S3B-S3E), followed by broad expression of the"

  "which labels MCL projection neurons and short axon juxtaglomerular cells in the GL (Figure 4A to J). Cell counts were performed at E13.5, when the vast majority of glutamatergic OB neurons have differentiated. We observed a significant reduction in the number of Tbr1+ (wild-type and Neurog2KI/KIn = 4; Neurog1\u2212/\u2212 and Neurog1/2\u2212/\u2212n = 3) and Tbr2+ (wild-type and Neurog2KI/KIn = 4; Neurog1\u2212/\u2212 and Neurog1/2\u2212/\u2212n = 3) glutamatergic neurons only in the Neurog1/2\u2212/\u2212 double-mutant OBLS compared with wild-type OBs (P <0.05 for both Tbr1 and Tbr2 counts; Figure 4I,J). We thus conclude that glutamatergic mitral and juxtaglomerular cells are born in normal numbers in Neurog2KI/KI and Neurog1\u2212/\u2212 single-mutant OBs, but these cells migrate inappropriately and fail to take up their correct positions in the Neurog1\u2212/\u2212 MCL and GL. In contrast, fewer glutamatergic neurons are born in the Neurog1/2\u2212/\u2212 OBLS, and these cells also migrate aberrantly. Neurog1 is upregulated in Neurog2\u2212/\u2212 olfactory bulbs The lack of an apparent defect in the Neurog2\u2212/\u2212 OB (at least at the morphological level and in glutamatergic lineages) was surprising given that fewer glutamatergic neurons are generated in Neurog2\u2212/\u2212 single-mutant neocortices. We previously attributed the Neurog2\u2212/\u2212 neocortical phenotype to a downregulation of Neurog1 expression in dorsomedial telencephalic domains,",
  "and Neurog2KI/KI (Figure 2K,K') mutant OBs, a distinct VZ, granule cell layer, MCL, GL and outer nerve layer (ONL) were apparent. In contrast, most of the post-mitotic neuronal layers were indistinct in the E18.5 Neurog1\u2212/\u2212 OB (Figure 2J,J') and Neurog1/2\u2212/\u2212 OBLS (Figure 2L,L'), although a VZ and granule cell layer were discernible in both mutants. We thus conclude that Neurog1 is required for proper growth and lamination of the OB, whereas Neurog1 and Neurog2 are together required for overall OB morphogenesis. We set out to identify the underlying cause(s) for the morphological and laminar defects in these proneural mutants. Defects in the migration of glutamatergic neurons in Neurog1\u2212/\u2212 OBs and migration and differentiation in Neurog1/2\u2212/\u2212 OBLSs The disruption of lamination in E18.5 Neurog1\u2212/\u2212 OBs and Neurog1/2\u2212/\u2212 OBLSs suggested that the neuronal subtypes that populate these layers may not differentiate properly. To test this, we first examined glutamatergic OB lineages, which are derived from Neurog1-expressing and Neurog2-expressing pallial progenitors, including projection neurons (mitral and tufted cells) and interneurons (juxtaglomerular cells) (see above, and). To label projection neurons in the MCL, we used a panel of dorsal telencephalic-specific markers, including NeuroD6Tcfap2eNrp1NeuroD1Reelin, Tbr1 and Tbr2 (Figure 3 and data not shown). Notably, Tcfap2e",
  "and data not shown). Notably, Tcfap2e also labels OB progenitors, and is one of the few definitive markers of an OB identity as it is not also expressed in neocortical lineages, unlike the rest of the markers we employed. To unambiguously identify the OBLS in Neurog1/2\u2212/\u2212 double mutants, the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), which lies between the neocortex and OB, was used as a landmark. In E18.5 Neurog2KI/+ embryos, the AON was labeled by GFP (data not shown), indicating that it is also derived from Neurog2-expressing pallial progenitors. In all E18.5 Neurog1/2 single and double mutants, the AON expressed GFP (data not shown), Neurod6 (Figure 3A,B,C,D) and Tbr1 (data not shown), indicating that AON development is not grossly perturbed by the loss of these proneural genes. In the main OB, expression of NeuroD6, Tcfap2e, Tbr1 and Tbr2 was detected in the OB VZ and MCL in E18.5 wild-type and Neurog2KI/KI null embryos (Figure 3A,C,E,G,I,K,M,O). In contrast, NeuroD6, Tcfap2e, Tbr1 and Tbr2-expressing cells were generated, but were disorganized in E18.5 Neurog1\u2212/\u2212 OBs, occupying ectopic positions in the outermost portion of the OB, where a mitral cell-deficient GL would normally form (Figure 3B,F,J,N).

  "which is predominantly expressed in the upper layer neurons, and Tbr1 at E15.5 (Figure 6D). In contrast to the significant size reduction observed in Dmrta2\u2212/\u2212 telencephalon, no size reduction was observed at E12.5, and only a slight reduction of the ventricular surface dimension was observed at E15.5 in brains with the conditional ablation of Dmrta2 (Figure 6E, data not shown). We also examined the cell cycle exit rate in Dmrta2-cKO brains, however, no significant change was observed (data not shown). Taken together, these results confirm that Dmrta2 predominantly contributes to early events of telencephalic development, including the formation of the cortical hem. Canonical Wnt Signaling Regulates the Expression of Dmrt3 and Dmrta2 The requirement of a Dmrta2 gradient for the development of medial structures raised the question of what regulates the expression of Dmrta2. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is one possible candidate for this role, given its involvement in the maintenance of neural progenitors in the medial cortex. To assess the possible role of Wnt signaling in Dmrta2 expression, we examined the overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Tcf3 (DN-Tcf3), which lacks the \u03b2-catenin-interacting domain and thus inhibits Tcf/Lef-dependent transcription. Here, we also examined the expression of Dmrt3 to"

  "Tbr1-positive neurons were located mainly in the lower cortical plate (layer 6) in wild-type mice (Figure 5A), whereas they were broadly scattered throughout the cortical plate in Lpiat1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 5B). Brn1 is a marker of the late precursor cells of the ventricular and subventricular zones and the migrating neurons. By E18.5, Brn1-positive neurons in wild-type mice had migrated into the cortical plate (Figure 5C), as shown previously, whereas most of the Brn1-positive neurons were stacked in the intermediate zone in Lpiat1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 5D). Cells positive for Reelin, a marker of Cajal\u2013Retzius neurons, were normally distributed in the marginal zone of the Lpiat1\u2212/\u2212 cortex (Figure 5, A and B). In the wild-type cortex, MAP2-positive neuronal processes were arranged radially and formed a tight, palisade-like structure (Figure 5E). In contrast, in Lpiat1\u2212/\u2212 mice, the palisade-like neuronal processes were disordered in the cortex, and the subplate neurons, which are also stained by MAP2, were dispersed (Figure 5F). Neuronal differentiation during early corticogenesis at E14.5 appeared normal in Lpiat1\u2212/\u2212 mice as assessed by the expressions of \u03b2III-tubulin, Tbr1, and MAP2 (Figure 6).
